# Emilio-Newton I am a returning college student. I am working towards my associates degree in computer science. I am interested in learning different programming and codes and how to solve issues and problems people or companies face on a daily basis. My favorite hobby is working out or bodybuilding. I love health and fitness and will continue it throughout my lifetime.
